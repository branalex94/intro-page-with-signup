## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to dynamically display warning messages using input "name" attribute values while handling forms.

### Continued development

I would like to keep improving the way to use ::after pseudo-element in CSS as well as better ways to handle forms and validations.

### Useful resources

- [RegEx](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php) - This helped know how to validate a proper email structure using regular expressions.

- [CSS ::after pseudo-element](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23554425/after-pseudo-element-is-not-showing-up) - This helped me better understand the usage of ::after CSS pseudo-element.
